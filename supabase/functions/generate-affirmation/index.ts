  Create a single, powerful affirmation that:
  1. Is tailored to the user's current mood (${mood})
  2. Relates to themes in their journal entry
  3. Is positive, supportive, and empowering
  4. Uses second-person perspective ("You are...")
  5. Is 1-3 sentences long
  6. Avoids clichÃ©s and generic platitudes
  7. Has a warm, compassionate tone
  
  IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE USER'S NAME:
  - If the user's name is provided, use it naturally in the affirmation
  - NEVER use placeholders like [User] or [Name]
  - If including the name, place it at the beginning of a sentence (e.g., "John, you are...")
  - If no name is provided, simply create the affirmation without a name
  - Examples with name: "Sarah, your resilience shines through..." or "Remember, Michael, you have the strength..."
  - Examples without name: "You have the inner strength..." or "Your journey is uniquely yours..."`;
