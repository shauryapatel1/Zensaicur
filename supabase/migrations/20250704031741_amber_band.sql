  # Fix Duplicate Badges

  1. Changes
    - Removes problematic badges that cause errors
    - Fixes duplicate "First Step" badges by consolidating them
    - Ensures all badge references are consistent
    - Cleans up any duplicate user_badge entries
  
  2. Reason
    - Duplicate badges were causing UI issues and confusion
    - Some badges had inconsistent categorization
    - This ensures a clean badge system with no duplicates
