  # Fix Duplicate Badges

  1. Changes
    - Removes problematic badges 'emotional-range' and 'streak-seeker'
    - Fixes duplicate 'First Step' badges by using a safer approach
    - Ensures only one canonical badge exists for each badge type
    - Updates user badge references to point to the correct badges
  
  2. Reason
    - Previous migration failed due to unique constraint violation
    - This approach avoids the constraint error by using a more careful update strategy
